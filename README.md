Pricing model for estimating optimal price ranges to boost sales while staying competitive

Project Overview

The GoAuto project aims to develop a robust pricing model for vehicles using machine learning techniques. This model leverages various vehicle attributes to predict fair market prices, helping both buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

Objective

The primary goal of this project is to create a pricing model for each vehicle based on key features such as make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant attributes. By analyzing historical data, the model provides accurate price estimates, reducing uncertainty in vehicle transactions.

Dataset

The dataset includes a comprehensive set of features related to vehicles, which are crucial for price prediction. Key features include:

Make: The brand of the vehicle (e.g., Toyota, Ford, BMW)

Model: The specific model of the car (e.g., Corolla, Mustang, X5)

Year: The manufacturing year of the vehicle

Mileage: The total distance traveled by the vehicle in kilometers or miles

Transmission: Type of transmission (Automatic, Manual, CVT, etc.)

Fuel Type: The type of fuel used (Gasoline, Diesel, Electric, Hybrid)

Engine Size: The displacement of the engine in liters

Horsepower: The power output of the engine

Condition: The overall state of the vehicle (New, Used, Certified Pre-Owned)

Location: The geographical region where the vehicle is sold

Market Price: The actual selling price of the vehicle, used as the target variable for prediction

Technology Stack

The project is implemented using the following technologies:

Python: Programming language for data analysis and model building

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing

Scikit-learn: Machine learning framework for model training and evaluation

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive code execution and documentation

Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw vehicle data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding patterns and trends in the dataset

Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating relevant features

Model Selection & Training: Comparing different regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)

Evaluation & Optimization: Assessing model performance and fine-tuning hyperparameters

Deployment: Preparing the model for real-world usage

Usage Instructions
